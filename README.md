# Password-Maker
This is a script that I wrote to generate complex passwords from a generated wordlist. The wordlist and the password.py file are all you need. The PWD.txt file is the file that is generated by this script and contains passwords for you to use.

## What problem does this solve?
This solves my personal problem of always needing secure passwords to use for my accounts with the results being outputted to a txt file for me to use for later if I needed to. This 

## What did I learn from building this?
* Filehandling, regex, functions
* Random() module
* Argparse() module, arg passing

## Why did I build this?
I built this to have a simple but useful password generation tool based on a long wordlist of random words. This is very good for when you want a password easily made up of words that you can easily type and remember but do not want to compromise on entropy.

## Features:
* Uses entropy(randomness generated) to guage password strength.
* Creates strong passwords based upon random words.
* Outputs to a file for later use
